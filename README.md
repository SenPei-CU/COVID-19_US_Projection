# Movies for projections of COVID-19 in US under different control measures

To evaluate the impact of control measures, we examined how daily confirmed cases within 6 months of February 21 2020 were modulated by percent reductions of the contact rate (effected by isolation, quarantine, telecommuting, school closure, etc.) and travel restrictions (effected by reducing commuting and travel among counties). The reductions of contact rates disrupt normal mixing within metapopulation locations, whereas the travel restrictions impact mixing between locations. In particular, we ran model simulations with no intervention (nointervention.mp4), a 25% reduction of contact rate (75%transmissibility.mp4), a 50% reduction of contact rate (50%transmissibility.mp4) and a 95% reduction of cross-county mobility (5%mobility.mp4).
